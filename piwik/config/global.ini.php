; If you want to change some of these default values, the best practise is to override 
; them in your configuration file in config/config.ini.php. If you directly edit this file,
; you risk losing your changes when you upgrade Piwik. 
; For example if you want to override action_title_category_delimiter, 
; edit config/config.ini.php and add the following:
; [General]
; action_title_category_delimiter = "-"
